An implementation of a SIGGRAPH paper:<br/>
Resolution Independent Curve Rendering using Programmable Graphics Hardware<br/>
by Charles Loop and Jim Blinn<br/>
SIGGRAPH 2005<br/>
http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1073204.1073303<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Note:<br/>
1. This project was built with Qt 5.x and OpenGL.<br/>
2. This is a Visual Studio 2010 project, so you need to use Windows. Luckily, you can easily port it to a Qt project by manually creating a .pro file.<br/>
3. If you decide to use Visual Studio, you need Qt Visual Studio add-in.<br/>
4. You also need Eigen Matrix Library (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)<br/>
